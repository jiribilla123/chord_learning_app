# Chord trainer


## About the project

I've been working with python for around 2 years basically for data science and analysis. <br>
Last semester I took a jazz guitar course and realized I had a lot of trouble identifying chords and notes in my guitar so I decided to develop and share this app.<br>
The first version includes just chord triads but (as expected for jazz) I am currently working on 7th chords, inversions, added 9th, 11th, 13th, etc.<br>
At first I was expecting to make the code for perosnal use but I found streamlit really friendly for UI and sharing.<br>
As I focused most on the UI for the first version, I'm using github for sharing, not taking branch structures and commits so serously but I will for further updates.
